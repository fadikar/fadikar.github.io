I am currently an Assistant Computational Statistician jointly in the [Decision and Infrastructure Sciences](https://www.anl.gov/dis) and the [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.mcs.anl.gov) divisions at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov). I am also a scientist at-Large fellow at University of Chicago Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering ([UChicago CASE](https://researchinnovation.uchicago.edu/)) Before that, I spent three years as a postdoc with [Stefan Wild](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~wild) at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov). I obtained my PhD in Statistics from [Virginia Tech](vt.edu) in July 2019, where I worked on [Stochastic Computer Model Calibration and Uncertainty Quantification](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/91985) with Prof. David Higdon.

# Research Interest

My broad research interests include, but not limited to, scalable algorithm for calibrating large scale computer models, inverse problem, uncertainty quantification, and bayesian optimization. I am particularly interested in finding ways to represent model inadequacy that is meaningful and facilitates extrapolation. Check project page for more details into my research.
